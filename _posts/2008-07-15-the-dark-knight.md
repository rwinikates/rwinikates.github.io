So I got a car this weekend!  Its a stick shift 1991 Isuzu Rodeo.  I never drove stick before this weekend.  But less than 36 hours after my first time driving a stick, I successfully got myself home in my "new" car.  I've been meaning to do a post on the cars of the campaign, but I haven't gotten around to it, but let me tell you that we've had a healthy naming culture for our cars, from "The Beast" to "The Mint Dragon" to "Red" and now my car is "The Dark Knight."  Here's a picture of me with the Knight in my driveway for you all to enjoy: <img alt="" src="http://images39.fotki.com/v1232/photos/3/335520/6476574/IMG_3370-vi.jpg" class="aligncenter" width="500" height="333" />
