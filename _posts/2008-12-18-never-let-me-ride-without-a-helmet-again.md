I just read a <a href="http://www.blueoregon.com/2008/12/didnt-i-just-bl.html">post</a> by a rockstar volunteer for the Oregon Bus Project about how he was in a bike accident. Most of us have heard a story like this at some point, including myself, yet occasionally I would ride my bike on campus without a helmet. No more. If any of you ever see me riding without, smack me.  To T.A., the author of the post, get better.  To Garrett, start wearing your helmet when you bike.

That said, the Garrett and I got to hang out at Rootscamp in DC last weekend, along with a bunch of other good folk.  Lots of interesting discussions, and it will be a much less intense task to summarize it than my times on the campaign, so that should be up shortly.  The only thing that would delay it is if my volunteer work at the Presidential Inaugural Committee sucks my life away today, but it looks like I will be able to sit here quietly reformatting computers for new staff.

One last note, I recently joined twitter, which is reposted here on the right, or you can follow me at <a class="superLinkifier" href="http://www.twitter.com/rodageo">http://www.twitter.com/rodageo</a>.  I'm still deciding whether or not I like twitter, but I figure I will give it a shot.  It was very useful at Rootscamp for updating the attendees.
