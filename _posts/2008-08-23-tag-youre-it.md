So it has been almost a month since I last posted, largely due to a promotion for me at work, where I was made IT director and youth vote coordinator at the beginning of August.  I am getting my first day off since I got here tomorrow, so in about 10 minutes I'm leaving to go camping in the Chugach National Forest and go see the Kenai Fjord National Park tomorrow.  Hopefully I'll have time to write more updates or at least post pictures after that.
