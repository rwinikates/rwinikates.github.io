So recently, Boeing painted one of their freighter jets with the Seahawks logo and flew it over Washington state in the pattern of #12, their quarterback's number.

This seemed like a very superfluous stunt to me, so I wanted to break down the numbers.

Based on some super rough math:

That plane can hold 63,000 gal of fuel and its range is 8,000 miles, giving it a mpg of 0.127 miles per gallon (albeit that’s probably while loaded, so lots of margin of error in here). [1]

That route was 1353 miles long. [2]

Aviation fuel is currently averaging $5.39 in the Pacific NW [3]

By my calculations, that means this flight needed 10,653 gallons of fuel, costing $57,422 for a relatively low-visibility publicity stunt.    This doesn’t include any personnel costs for the pilots, mechanics or other support staff either.

And yet, it is so much cheaper than buying a Super Bowl ad.

Yes, I ruin everything.
