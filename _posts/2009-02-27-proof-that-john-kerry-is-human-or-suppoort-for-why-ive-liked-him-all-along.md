Politico has an <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0209/19345.html">interview</a> with him, reminds me of the Al Gore video that made people say "Why couldn't he be like this during the campaign??"  Some of my favorites include the following:

Q: Tell us your favorite joke.

A: On the advice of my attorney, my family and every member of my staff, I am no longer allowed to tell jokes. 

Q: On what types of products do you never go cheap, for the sake of quality?

A: Ketchup. 

Q: How often do you Google yourself?

A: When I was growing up, the priests taught us to think that was a sin. 

<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0209/19345.html">Read on</a> to see comments comparing himself to Blagojevich and his comments about Red Sox and Patriots as they pertain to his life.

Also, I know things have been quiet on the BostonRob front, I've been working on a new blog to launch that I'm hosting myself.  It allows me to geek out a bit and do some customizations I'm not able to do on the free, yet limited account I have here.  More to come soon.
