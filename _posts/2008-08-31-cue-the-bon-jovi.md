<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUSDS9pkA2Y">Woah, we're halfway there!</a>

Yes, folks, today is my halfway point from when I arrived in Alaska till election day.  Crazy to think that I have been here longer now than it is till the most important day in the next 4 years.  Crazy to think that of the relatively few hours I have slept in my first half here, there will be even fewer going forward, thanks to ever expanding work hours.

I have had good times out here.  Our staff is full of good folks.  The Alaskan scenery is beautiful.  The really long days from the beginning of the summer really are still impressive, although it is getting dark earlier and earlier every day.  I most certainly have written more than half of my blog posts about Alaska, and I apologize for being so sparse in my updates, but I hope you all understand.

But for now I will leave you all with warm wishes from the last frontier!
