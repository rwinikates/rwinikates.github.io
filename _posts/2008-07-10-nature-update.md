So after call time this evening, my regional field director, blogger, housemate and I went for a hike!  We grabbed the dog from one of our supporter homes and got to enjoy the beautiful Alaskan sunset from the top of Blueberry hill.  Pictures of the sunset, me, the dog, my coworkers, and the mountains are forthcoming (this was a last minute trip so I didn't have my camera with me.  I need to get a small camera again).  We saw a moose in the distance while hiking, and something that could have been a brown bear, but it was too far away to get a positive id on it.  

Something that I got to see much more up close and personal was the moose munching on the foliage in my front yard when I came back.  Here's a gallery of the shots I got with my camera.  [gallery]
