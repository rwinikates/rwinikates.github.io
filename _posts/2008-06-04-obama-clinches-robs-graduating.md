I feel that this makes an appropriate first posting, as it covers two of the major areas that this blog will be covering: politics and me.  Last night, Senator Barack Obama gained enough delegates that he has a majority of  those available in the Democratic primary process. This coincided with the beginning of the Harvard commencement activities, making yesterday a very good day.

For a procedural note, I want to post here as frequently as I can, yet I can imagine that there will be times when I do not post, so I highly highly encourage people to use an RSS reader to consume the content of this blog by clicking on the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/BostonRob">subscribe link</a> to the right with the orange button.  If you do not use RSS, click <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/emailverifySubmit?feedId=2066998&amp;amp;loc=en_US">here</a> to have posts delivered via email.

I do hope that I can use this as a forum to keep people updated on what it is that I am doing, so please go ahead and post comments here or email me, because if you are reading this, you likely have my email already.  I may create a special email account for this blog so I can post it for those who might not have my email address, something to think about.
