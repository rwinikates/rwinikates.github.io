<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">During the <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/03/23/175119418/sheer-madness-with-ncaa-upsets">weekend edition sports coverage of the NCAA March Madness basketball tournament today (3/23/13)</a>, Tom Goldman said that Harvard was &quot;buying big into sports&quot; and that it was using its large endowment to win sports games. &nbsp;I find this terribly irresponsible reporting, as according to </span><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/sandbox/business/ncaa.html" style="line-height: 1.538em;">this New Yorker interactive</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">, Harvard is the 6th cheapest basketball program in the tournament.&nbsp;</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This coverage showed a real divergence from the facts. &nbsp;Does Harvard have a big endowment? Yes. &nbsp;Has it maybe even increased spending on athletics recently? &nbsp;Possibly, I don&#39;t know. &nbsp;However, it is unfair to compare its athletic budget as &quot;buying games&quot; when compared with many teams in this competition.</div><div>&nbsp;</div>
