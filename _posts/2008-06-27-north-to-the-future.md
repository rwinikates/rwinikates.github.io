So tomorrow I get on a plane to head to Anchorage, Alaska, where I will be working on a political campaign.  This is very exciting for me personally, since it will hopefully be a good combination of my enjoyment of politics and nature.  While I've had less than a week to plan and get ready for this trip, which will last until mid-November, I'm basically packed and look forward to updating folks with fun stories from the land of the (almost) midnight sun.

As a side educational note, "north to the future" is the state motto of Alaska, <a href="http://www.netstate.com/states/mottoes/ak_motto.htm">according</a> to the Alaska Statutes of 2004, Title 44, Chapter 44.09, 		Section 44.09.045.
