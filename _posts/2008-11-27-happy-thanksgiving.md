So I have not really been updating this blog.  I appreciate that people do read it, and I want to wish everyone out there a Happy Thanksgiving.  The following are just a few of the things I am thankful for:
<ul>
	<li>That I live in a safe country.  My heart goes out to the people of Mumbai today.</li>
	<li>That all of the hard work that countless numbers of people, myself included, paid off in electing Barack Obama our next president.  I was on the journey much less time than some, but I left it all on the field, and I am grateful for that opportunity.</li>
	<li>That my family does everything they can to support me in whatever I am doing. (Currently? Unemployment.  They still find ways to be supportive, it is amazing.)</li>
	<li>That my friends from outside the campaign still want to talk to me after being so absent for so long and that my friends from the campaign have been there for me and will continue to do so.</li>
	<li>That Harvard beat yale yet again.</li>
	<li>That my time off now means I get a chance to catch up on sleep.  Yes, I am still working on that.</li>
</ul>
There is so much more to be thankful for, and I am really feeling like a pretty lucky guy right now.  Now that the campaign is done, I hope to write a few posts about some of my experiences in it, since I had to maintain radio silence about it (voluntarily).  I wish everyone well, and hope that you have a Thanksgiving with good people.
