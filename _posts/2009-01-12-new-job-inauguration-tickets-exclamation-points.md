So I <a href="http://bostonrob.wordpress.com/2009/01/01/happy-new-year/">came to DC</a> a little over a week ago, and I'm happy to announce that today I accepted a job at <a href="http://ngpsoftware.com/">NGP Software</a>.  The major product of NGP is software that tracks political donations and then helps the campaign or party client submit their compliance reports to the FEC and the respective state ethics boards.  So there is a lot to be learned, but I am quite excited about it.  I'll be starting after the inauguration and it turns out I work in an area with a lot of other friends from school.  This looks to be a job where I could be happy for a while, so I'm in DC for the foreseeable future. Next big life decision?  Where to live.  I have a lot of Craigslisting to do.

I also promised some people pictures of my inauguration tickets, so check them out below![gallery columns="2"]
