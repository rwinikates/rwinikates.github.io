Disclaimer: These are all links that give me some sort of kickback. I use each of these services personally. If you want to use them and help me out at the same time, cool. If not, no big deal.

- [Bing Rewards](http://www.bing.com/explore/rewards?PUBL=REFERAFRIEND&CREA=RAW&rrid=_c9feb5ad-3d7c-e93f-884c-9221f773aa60) I have a macro set up to run searches on this every day, gets me a $5 Amazon gift card about once a month. I get points towards my next redemption of an Amazon giftcard.
- [Groupon](https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/82a46eb9-5fa7-44d3-87e3-9965e02a9028) The deals site. You almost certainly have an account already. I get a $10 groupon gift card. 
- [Dropbox](https://db.tt/cpeZvlhU) an invaluable service for syncing files between computers.  **You get a bonus 500mb** of space if you use this link (as do I)!
- [SmartyPig](https://www.smartypig.com) I have to email you a code, this is one of the best saving accounts by APY out there. I get $10 deposited into a savings account (I use this to save for things like a new laptop, chip in $30/month for a few years every month, then cash out to pay for the new thingy, having already "paid" for it in installments by transferring money to this account).
- [Hulu Plus](http://www.hulu.com/r/4nXfSA) We both get two free weeks of Hulu Plus, great for watching current TV on a mobile device or Roku/AppleTV/etc.
- [Trello](https://trello.com/robwinikates/recommend) I use this at work to help organize tasks, its super slick. I get silly add-ons like the ability to add stickers to my tasks.
