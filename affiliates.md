Disclaimer: These are all links that give me some sort of kickback. I use each of these services personally. If you want to use them and help me out at the same time, cool. If not, no big deal.

- [Bing Rewards](http://www.bing.com/explore/rewards?PUBL=REFERAFRIEND&CREA=RAW&rrid=_c9feb5ad-3d7c-e93f-884c-9221f773aa60) I have a macro set up to run searches on this every day, gets me a $5 Amazon gift card about once a month. I get points towards my next redemption of an Amazon giftcard.
- [Groupon](https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/82a46eb9-5fa7-44d3-87e3-9965e02a9028) The deals site. You almost certainly have an account already. I get a $10 groupon gift card. 
- [Dropbox](https://db.tt/cpeZvlhU) an invaluable service for syncing files between computers.  **You get a bonus 500mb** of space if you use this link (as do I)!
- [SmartyPig](https://www.smartypig.com) I have to email you a code, this is one of the best saving accounts by APY out there. I get $10 deposited into a savings account (I use this to save for things like a new laptop, chip in $30/month for a few years every month, then cash out to pay for the new thingy, having already "paid" for it in installments by transferring money to this account).
- [Hulu Plus](http://www.hulu.com/r/4nXfSA) We both get two free weeks of Hulu Plus, great for watching current TV on a mobile device or Roku/AppleTV/etc.
- [Trello](https://trello.com/robwinikates/recommend) I use this at work to help organize tasks, its super slick. I get silly add-ons like the ability to add stickers to my tasks.
- [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com/r/117341) Allows you to schedule when your social media profiles post, and can also do some analytics.  We both get to have an extra slot in our queue of posts to go out if you use my link.
- [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?uid=61101&sig=3dfc71a06515d7731c27f446efff0443) The capture-everything notebook. I've been using this basically since it came out, I love keeping my recipes in it. We both get extra space per month to upload if you use this link.
- [Seamless](http://seamless.extole.com/a/clk/2C2qlm) An online food ordering service.  We both get $7 off our next order if you use this link.
- [Foodler](http://www.foodler.com/ref/108865a4/brighton) Another online food ordering service. We both get credit towards an order through their service (or other things too, like cashback or starbucks cards).
- [Zapier](http://zpr.io/PfDP) A service that can automate actions in one service based on another.  Like [IFTTT](ifttt.com) but on steroids. Still very easy to use. We both get extra tasks executed per month if you use my link.

## Programs I still need to get the details worked out on:
- Amazon
- Skype
-
